#1 in ALLM go to settings and developer api and generate and copy an api key - (you will be able to copy it later)

#2 open a terminal into the repo and enter `pip install requests`

#3 run the small test to check if the api is working

`API_KEY="<your-api-key-here" python list_workspaces.py`

#4 your result should be information about David Lynch's acting as well as the contexts the query was relevant to

#5 run the real test to query the rag

`API_KEY="<your-api-key-here" python query_workspace.py`

#6 a few mins later your result should include a list of actors and shows

üëç we have queried the RAG databaase
