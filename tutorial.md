## Setup and test

#1 install anything LLM & follow instructions to run locally

    - Select an LLM (AnythingLLM : Gemma2)

#2 Create a workspace named "David Lynch" and click on the button to upload files

#3 Drag in JUST the "Experimental Film" from the "rag-film-types" folder for now

#4 Select the file and move it to the workspace and then scroll all the way down to save your changes

#5 go to the prefs for the workspace 

    - set the chat type to "query"
    - set the temperature to 0
    - click the "update workspace" button

NOTE: TRY NOT TO USE THE DEFAULT CHAT - IT CAN'T BE DELETED SO IT'S ANSWERS WILL BECOME SHARED DATA (?)

#6 click on the "NEW CHAT" tab and type in: "What was the name of David Lynch's first wife?" 

#7 the answer should come back very quickly (because of the low temp and the small amount of data)

üëç we have confirmed installation and creation of the RAG database by querying and receiving a response

#### context test

#8 add the file "Filmography" to your workspace

#9 delete the old chats and ask again in a new one: "What was the name of David Lynch's first wife?" 

#10 the answer have some information and a bit slower for the larger amount of data

üëç good - now where is the code ??

## Coooooooode !!

#1 in ALLM go to settings and developer api and generate and copy an api key - (you will be able to copy it later)

#2 open a terminal into the repo and enter `pip install requests`

#3 run the small test to check if the api is working

`API_KEY="<your-api-key-here" python list_workspaces.py`

#4 your result should be information about David Lynch's acting as well as the contexts the query was relevant to

#5 run the real test to query the rag

`API_KEY="<your-api-key-here" python query_workspace.py`

#6 a few mins later your result should include a list of actors and shows

üëç we have queried the RAG databaase

- general understanding
